**[Success for Sale][0]**

First of all...Happy Anniversary to Us! It has been a wonderful, sometimes strange, yet always creative journey over the past 30 years. We wish to thank all of our clients, suppliers, friends, and family for helping to make us a success story.

Now onto the introduction...

Creative Effects is an award-winning Advertising and Design Studio established in 1986 to give local businesses the opportunity to deal with a full-service advertising firm. Since then we have expanded our capabilities to allow us to service regional, national and international accounts.

We combine the need for advertising direction, marketing and media planning with the creative ability to execute our recommendations. We do this through exceptional creative design, meticulous technical ability, detailed planning and old-fashioned hard work.

Creative Effects can also negotiate your media buys. We have been working directly with local, national and international media for over twenty-five years. We understand the system and how to get you the best coverage at the best rates.

Our state of the art electronic equipment is continuously upgraded and allows us to do all pre-press work in-house saving both valuable time and money while giving us complete creative freedom and quality control. By networking with top professional printers, illustrators, photographers and video production experts, we can match the subcontractor to our client's specific needs and budget.
